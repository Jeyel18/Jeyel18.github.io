                    <h26><span> My professional goal is to seek and look for a position as a Full-Stack Developer after I graduate from college. I decided to specialize in computer programming as a stack developer because this is what I want to do and what my other relatives do for a living. Even though it can be challenging, I always enjoy designing and building websites. I prefer it because the demand is high and you can get a good salary. I want to work as a full-stack developer because I enjoy and get excited every time I build a website, so this is what I want to do for a career.</span></h26>
